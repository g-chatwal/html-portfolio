<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey is filled with memories of many enjoyable walks with my father. We discussed constellations, tracked low-orbit satellites, watched comedies in theatres, and built simple experimental electronic circuits at home. I laughed, cried, and marvelled through these experiences, which unknowingly ignited a deep passion for science and technology, setting me on a path of exploration and innovation.</p>

<p>I grew up as a technologist and adventurer with an entrepreneurial mindset, earning me the distinction of 'Expert Engineer' at Fiserv. As Vice President of Innovation and Intelligent Automation for Fiserv, I lead transformation programs and incubate fintech products to drive cost and revenue impact in a regulated and fast-paced financial industry.</p>

<p>My career has spanned India, Europe, and the US while working with global IT players, multicultural teams, startups, and educational institutions. Through my career, I have embraced many choices, willingly picking up new opportunities, sometimes risky. I remain passionate about physics, high-performance computing, deep learning architecture, and functional programming. This curiosity has taken me from teaching undergrad students, researching deep learning and self-organising systems, being a chocolatier, to founding four startups (consulting, fashion casual wear, mobile healthcare, and Legal tech), and enjoying photography.</p>
<p>As a business coach and trainer/facilitator for leadership skills, AI, and Systems Thinking, I find fulfilment in empowering individuals and organisations to achieve growth. Pursuing my passion for contributing to education, I founded the SARAL (Science and Robotics Action Learning) school to curate interdisciplinary learning and nurture the next generation of technologists and innovators.</p>

<p>I have been working with deep learning applications since 1990, and in my spare time, I provide tech advisory services to professionals and startups. Letâ€™s connect and explore opportunities to collaborate.</p>
